Ya OK (Я ОК) - Secure Delay-Tolerant Messaging for Emergency Situations

Stay connected when traditional networks fail. Ya OK uses delay-tolerant networking (DTN) to deliver messages even in low-connectivity environments through Bluetooth, WiFi Direct, and relay fallback.

🌟 KEY FEATURES:

✅ Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN)
Messages route through nearby devices (A→B→C) to reach distant recipients. Perfect for disaster zones, remote areas, or network outages.

✅ Multiple Transport Options
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for nearby devices
- WiFi Direct for faster local transfer
- UDP relay fallback when internet available
- Automatic transport switching

✅ End-to-End Encryption
- Ed25519 digital signatures for authenticity
- X25519 key exchange for perfect forward secrecy
- AES-GCM-256 authenticated encryption
- Your messages stay private, always

✅ Delivery Confirmation
Honest "received" and "delivered" acknowledgments so you know your message arrived safely.

✅ Three Message Types
- Status: "I'm OK", "Busy", "Later"
- Text: Up to 256 characters (emoji supported)
- Voice: Up to 7 seconds audio

✅ Priority Queue
High-priority emergency messages sent first, even with limited connectivity.

✅ Trusted Peer Management
Add trusted contacts via QR codes. Messages only delivered to verified peers.

🔒 SECURITY & PRIVACY:

Your messages are end-to-end encrypted. Not even our relay servers can read them. All cryptographic operations happen on your device. We don't collect, store, or sell your data.

- No phone numbers required
- No account registration
- No tracking or analytics

• Hiking and outdoor activities
• International travel without roaming

🌍 HOW IT WORKS:

1. Install Ya OK on your device
2. Exchange keys with trusted contacts (QR codes)
3. Send messages via BLE, WiFi, or relay
4. Messages automatically route through nearby devices
5. Receive delivery confirmations

Even if your recipient is offline, nearby devices store and forward your message until it reaches them.

⚡ TECHNICAL DETAILS:

- Rust core for reliability and security
- SQLite local storage with deduplication
- CRC32 checksums for data integrity
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Automatic peer timeout (5 minutes)

🛡️ PERMISSIONS:

- Bluetooth: For BLE discovery and messaging
